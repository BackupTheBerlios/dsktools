README for dsktools Version 0.2.0
=================================

Introduction
------------

Thanks for downloading dsktools. ;-)

dsktools is a set of tools for reading and writing DSK and EDSK images to real
floppy disks for use with the Amstrad/Schneider CPC range of homecomputers.
The main target platform for dsktools is GNU/Linux.

Current State
-------------

dskwrite is able to write images in standard formats (SYSTEM,DATA) as well as
some special formats with unusual sector numbering and sector sizes and
deleted data (untested). There are no options for selecting the drive, side,
etc. yet. Only the first side of the floppy disk in /dev/fd0 is used (for
single sided images).

dskread is much more complete than in older revisions. It understand some copy
protected formats and takes command line options for selecting drive, side,
number of sides and number of tracks. See dskread -h for a list of known
options.

Compiling and Installing
------------------------

Just type in "make".
Optionally copy the resulting binaries "dskread" and "dskwrite" to some
directory in your PATH, /usr/local/bin for example.

Usage
-----

Straight-forward, really.

./dskread <filename>

will read the disk in drive /dev/fd0 and dump the contents into a DSK image
file. For non-standard formats there are a bunch of command line options. See
dskread -h for a list of available options.

./dskwrite <filename>

will read the contents of a DSK image file and write it to a floppy disk in
drive /dev/fd0.

Future
------

Future versions of dskwrite will handle different copy protection schemes,
faithfully reproducing the original disk from the image. I hope to get this
support as complete as it is in CPDWrite under DOS. I will also implement some
command line options to make dsktools more flexible and user friendly.
